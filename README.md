Webmin before 1.290 and Usermin before 1.220 calls the simplify_path function before decoding HTML, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, as demonstrated using "..%01" sequences, which bypass the removal of "../" sequences before bytes such as "%01" are removed from the filename.

Usage: python3 webmin.py <IP>:<PORT> <FILE>
Example: python3 webmin.py 192.168.1.1:10000 /etc/passwd
